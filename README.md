**-*TUG: GUI Unit Testing ("Testing Unitario GUI", in Spanish) for Qt applications*-** 

TUG is a framework to create batteries of tests for Qt applications in Linux, Windows and OS systems. 

The TUG framework is based on the Qt Test framework, and is composed of two elements:
* TUGLib: a C++ library to support GUI unit testing (requires Qt 4.8 or higher).
* TUG Wizard: wizard application to create test projects (requires Java RE).


# what does TUG provide?

[![TUG VIDEO](http://img.youtube.com/vi/tUis6JrycrA/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUis6JrycrA)

After 7 steps, 3-5 minutes and no code, you get:
* 1000+ lines of code generated
* test projects ready to compile and run
* only test actions remain to be coded
* all tests and testsuites arranged into a standalone project: 1 test suite = 1 subproject = 1 binary
* high-level, interactive reports on the web browser
* profiling and coverage analysis


# what does a TUG package/release contain?

A new release can be created by executing "scripts/create_release.sh". This script receives the version
number as a single argument.

Generated releases can be found at "releases/" folder. Each one includes:

* doc/............. usage quick guide
* libTUG_project/.. C++ project of GUI unit testing library.
* TUG_wizard/...... wizard application to create test projects (requires Java RE).
* install.sh....... libTUG installer. Type "./install.sh --help" for further info.
   
Please, go to "doc/" folder and open TUG_doc.pdf to find a quick usage guide and 
further information about this testing framework.

# about

TUG project was born with the main purpose of providing a unit testing framework for graphical user interfaces. The main goal was providing developers with a method to easily create a battery of tests for Qt-based applications. The tests had to simulate, as far as possible, users interaction with the interface.

With this purpose, the TUG project is divided into two main components:

* **TUG Wizard**: a wizard-like application that helps developers to create and configure, step by step, a test project aimed at testing a Qt based panel as well as the underlying model and communication classes (if they exists). It generates a new panel inheriting the original one. This new panel includes customized methods to simulate users interaction with the widgets composing the panel. It can also generate a full, standalone test project including testsuites and empty test methods ready for being filled with testing code.

* **TUG Base Library**: a library aimed at supporting the tests generated by TUG Wizard, as well as test projects created manually by developers. It provides a way to structure test suites, as well as a set of methods to support the definition of GUI tests, all around the Qt Test framework.
