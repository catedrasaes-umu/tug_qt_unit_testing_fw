# TUG Framework

**-*TUG: GUI Unit Testing ("Testing Unitario GUI", in Spanish) for Qt applications*-** 

TUG project was born with the main purpose of providing a unit testing framework for graphical user interfaces. The main goal was providing developers with a method to easily create a battery of tests for Qt-based applications. The tests had to simulate, as far as possible, users interaction with the interface.

With this purpose, the TUG project is divided into two main components:

* **TUG Wizard**: a wizard-like application that helps developers to create and configure, step by step, a test project aimed at testing a Qt based panel as well as the underlying model and communication classes (if they exists). It generates a new panel inheriting the original one. This new panel includes customized methods to simulate users interaction with the widgets composing the panel. It can also generate a full, standalone test project including testsuites and empty test methods ready for being filled with testing code.

* **TUG Base Library**: a library aimed at supporting the tests generated by TUG Wizard, as well as test projects created manually by developers. It provides a way to structure test suites, as well as a set of methods to support the definition of GUI tests, all around the Qt Test framework.
  
*The TUG Project is an initiative of CÃ¡tedra SAES (http://www.catedrasaes.org) funded by the SAES company
(http://www.electronica-submarina.com). This project and all its components have been designed and developed at University of Murcia (Spain).*
