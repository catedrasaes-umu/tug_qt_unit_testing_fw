TUG bases on the Qt Test framework.","body":"# TUG Framework\r\n\r\nTUG -- GUI Unit Testing (\"Testing Unitario GUI\", in Spanish) for Qt applications. \r\n\r\nTUG project was born with the main purpose of providing a unit testing framework for graphical user interfaces. The main goal was providing developers with a method to easily create a battery of tests for Qt-based applications. The tests had to simulate, as far as possible, users interaction with the interface.\r\n\r\nWith this purpose, the TUG project is divided into two main components:\r\n\r\n* **TUG Wizard**: a wizard-like application that helps developers to create and configure, step by step, a test project aimed at testing a Qt based panel as well as the underlying model and communication classes (if they exists). It generates a new panel inheriting the original one. This new panel includes customized methods to simulate users interaction with the widgets composing the panel. It can also generate a full, standalone test project including testsuites and empty test methods ready for being filled with testing code.\r\n\r\n* **TUG Base Library**: a library aimed at supporting the tests generated by TUG Wizard, as well as test projects created manually by developers. It provides a way to structure test suites, as well as a set of methods to support the definition of GUI tests, all around the Qt Test framework.\r\n  \r\n*The TUG Project is an initiative of CÃ¡tedra SAES (http://www.catedrasaes.org) funded by the SAES company\r\n(http://www.electronica-submarina.com). This project and all its components have been designed and developed at University of Murcia (Spain).*\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
