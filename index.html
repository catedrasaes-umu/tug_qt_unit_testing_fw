<p>TUG -- GUI Unit Testing ("Testing Unitario GUI", in Spanish) for Qt applications. </p>

<p>TUG project was born with the main purpose of providing a unit testing framework for graphical user interfaces. The main goal was providing developers with a method to easily create a battery of tests for Qt-based applications. The tests had to simulate, as far as possible, users interaction with the interface.</p>

<p>With this purpose, the TUG project is divided into two main components:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>TUG Wizard</strong>: a wizard-like application that helps developers to create and configure, step by step, a test project aimed at testing a Qt based panel as well as the underlying model and communication classes (if they exists). It generates a new panel inheriting the original one. This new panel includes customized methods to simulate users interaction with the widgets composing the panel. It can also generate a full, standalone test project including testsuites and empty test methods ready for being filled with testing code.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TUG Base Library</strong>: a library aimed at supporting the tests generated by TUG Wizard, as well as test projects created manually by developers. It provides a way to structure test suites, as well as a set of methods to support the definition of GUI tests, all around the Qt Test framework.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>The TUG Project is an initiative of CÃ¡tedra SAES (<a href="http://www.catedrasaes.org">http://www.catedrasaes.org</a>) funded by the SAES company
(<a href="http://www.electronica-submarina.com">http://www.electronica-submarina.com</a>). This project and all its components have been designed and developed at University of Murcia (Spain).</em></p>
