<p><strong>-<em>TUG: GUI Unit Testing ("Testing Unitario GUI", in Spanish) for Qt applications</em>-</strong> </p>

<p>A framework to create batteries of tests for Qt applications. TUG bases on the Qt Test framework.</p>

<p>A video better than a thausand words: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUis6JrycrA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUis6JrycrA</a></p>

<p>After 7 steps, 3-5 minutes and no code, you get:</p>

<ul>
<li>1000+ lines of code generated</li>
<li>test projects ready to compile and run</li>
<li>only test actions remain to be coded</li>
<li>all tests and testsuites arranged into a standalone project: 1 test suite = 1 subproject = 1 binary</li>
<li>high-level, interactive reports on the web browser</li>
<li>profiling and coverage analysis</li>
</ul>

<a id="about" class="anchor" href="#about" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About</h2>

<p>TUG project was born with the main purpose of providing a unit testing framework for graphical user interfaces. The main goal was providing developers with a method to easily create a battery of tests for Qt-based applications. The tests had to simulate, as far as possible, users interaction with the interface.</p>

<p>With this purpose, the TUG project is divided into two main components:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>TUG Wizard</strong>: a wizard-like application that helps developers to create and configure, step by step, a test project aimed at testing a Qt based panel as well as the underlying model and communication classes (if they exists). It generates a new panel inheriting the original one. This new panel includes customized methods to simulate users interaction with the widgets composing the panel. It can also generate a full, standalone test project including testsuites and empty test methods ready for being filled with testing code.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TUG Base Library</strong>: a library aimed at supporting the tests generated by TUG Wizard, as well as test projects created manually by developers. It provides a way to structure test suites, as well as a set of methods to support the definition of GUI tests, all around the Qt Test framework.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>The TUG Project is an initiative of CÃ¡tedra SAES (<a href="http://www.catedrasaes.org">http://www.catedrasaes.org</a>) funded by the SAES company
(<a href="http://www.electronica-submarina.com">http://www.electronica-submarina.com</a>). This project and all its components have been designed and developed at University of Murcia (Spain).</em></p>
